## Getting Started

**Follow the nex step if you want to run the project in you local machine üíª**

### Prerequisites

- Have a copy of this project
- Have Ruby v2.6.5 installed
- Have Ruby on Rails v5.2.4.3 installed

### Setup

- Clone this project running `git clone git@github.com:meme-es/movie-reviews.git`.
- Enter the movie-reviews folder.
- Run  `bundle` or `bundle install --without production` to install gems needed to run the project.
- Migrate the database with the next command `rails db:migrate`.
- Run the server with `rails server` or the short version `rails s`.
- Open the localhost:3000 in your favorite browser, and that's all.

### Usage

When you run the project using your machine as a local server then you can open the application in a web browser you will see a window like in the image in the top but without content, because you did not already write any review.

After running the project the first step is to create a user to let you use all the functions in the application, that functions are:

- Create reviews.

- Choose a category with related reviews by clicking on the image of the category.

- Vote for your favorite reviews making click over the thumbs-up icon, or undo your vote making click again.

### Run tests

If you want to check the test you have to open the root folder of the project and run the next instructions:

- `rspec`, this will run all the tests.
- `rspec <file_name>`, to run a specific file or folder stored in the spec folder.

If you experiment any trouble with the database you may need to make migration with the next instruction:

```
bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

Another important thing is that on some occasions the integration test could be to heave, some `sleep(5)` give time to the server to process some requests.
